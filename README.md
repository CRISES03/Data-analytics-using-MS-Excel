# Data-analytics-using-MS-Excel
In this project, I leveraged the data provided to me and applied my analytical skills to generate valuable insights. Through the use of Microsoft Excel, I created pivot tables and interactive dashboards that presented the data in a clear and visually appealing manner. These pivot tables and dashboards allowed for a comprehensive view of the data, enabling stakeholders to quickly grasp trends, patterns, and key metrics. The insights derived from these analyses provided actionable information to support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning within the organization. By utilizing Microsoft Excel's powerful features, I facilitated the effective communication of complex data, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the project.
